        android:text="A human player competes against the computer. Both players throw 5 dice at the same time.
The score of each throw for each player is the sum of the numbers shown on the faces of the
dice. The objective of the game is to reach a score of 101 or more (instead of 101 another target
can be set by the human before play starts) by throwing 5 dice as many times as necessary.
After a roll, each player may either score it or take up to two optional rerolls. For each reroll,
they may reroll all of the dice or select any of the dice to keep and only reroll the remainder.
A player may score at any time, thus ending their current throw; after the second reroll (three
rolls in total) they must score it.
1
After both players score their rolls, the procedure is repeated until one of the players reach
101 or more points by summing all of their scores. If both players reach 101 or more with
the same number of attempts (a single attempt is considered as one roll followed by 2 optional
rerolls) the player with the highest score wins.
